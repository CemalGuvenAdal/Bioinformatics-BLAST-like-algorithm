# Bioinformatics-BLAST-like-algorithm
In this program I have developed a BLAST like algorithm in python. I have seperated all the kmers in a given sequence according
to their starting letter(ACGT). Then I have used seed and extend method for each query and sequence in order to keep indexes and the score
in my seedextend() and scorethreshold() functions. I have alligned the query and the sequence accordingly in my allign() function
Lastly each start index for each query is shown as it is asked in the homework.
Note:
because in the  output it doesnt alligments it is commented. If wanted comment in the line 254 can be deleted in order to see alligments.
